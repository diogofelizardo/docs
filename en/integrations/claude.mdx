## Overview

Surf Data integrates natively with Claude through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Once configured, Claude can discover and call your published tools to query your databases directly in conversation.

## Claude Desktop

### Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish your project">
    Make sure your Surf Data project is [published](/en/platform/publishing) and you have a Bearer token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Claude Desktop settings">
    In Claude Desktop, navigate to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**.

    This opens the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the MCP server">
    Add Surf Data as an MCP server:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "surf-data": {
          "url": "https://surfdata.com.br/mcp/http",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_your-token-here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Close and reopen Claude Desktop. You should see the Surf Data tools available in the tools menu.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Usage

Once configured, you can ask Claude to use your tools naturally:

> "Look up customer with ID 12345"

> "What are the top 10 orders this month?"

> "Find all active subscriptions for the Growth plan"

Claude will automatically select the appropriate tool, pass the right parameters, and present the results in a readable format.

### Multiple projects

To connect multiple Surf Data projects, add separate entries:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "surf-data-customers": {
      "url": "https://surfdata.com.br/mcp/http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_customer-token"
      }
    },
    "surf-data-analytics": {
      "url": "https://surfdata.com.br/mcp/http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_analytics-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Code

### Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the MCP config">
    In your project root, create a `.mcp.json` file:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "surf-data": {
          "url": "https://surfdata.com.br/mcp/http",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_your-token-here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Claude Code">
    Launch Claude Code in your terminal. It will automatically detect the MCP configuration and connect to Surf Data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Usage in Claude Code

Claude Code can use your Surf Data tools while working on code:

```
> Use the get_customer_by_id tool to fetch customer 456 and help me
  build a dashboard component for their data
```

```
> Query the recent_orders tool and generate a TypeScript interface
  matching the response structure
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tools not appearing">
    - Verify your project is published
    - Check that the Bearer token is valid and not expired
    - Restart Claude Desktop after changing the config
    - Check the MCP server URL is correct
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    - Verify the token starts with `sk_live_`
    - Check the token hasn't been revoked or deactivated
    - Ensure the `Authorization` header format is `Bearer <token>` (with a space)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool execution failures">
    - Check the [Evals dashboard](/en/monitoring/evals) for error details
    - Verify your datasource connection is still valid
    - Check if you've reached your execution limit
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow responses">
    - Complex queries may take longer; check execution times in the Evals dashboard
    - Verify your database server is healthy and responsive
    - Consider optimizing your SQL queries or adding database indexes
  </Accordion>
