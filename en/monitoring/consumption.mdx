## Overview

The **Consumption Dashboard** provides real-time visibility into how your organization's tool executions are being used. Monitor usage patterns, track limits, and identify optimization opportunities.

## Accessing the dashboard

Navigate to **Consumption** in the sidebar to view your usage metrics.

## Metrics overview

The dashboard displays several key metrics:

### Execution count

The total number of tool executions in the current billing period.

- **Current usage** — how many executions have been made
- **Plan limit** — your monthly execution allowance
- **Usage percentage** — visual progress bar showing consumption

### Execution breakdown

A chart showing executions over time with breakdowns by:

- **Status** — Success, Error, Timeout
- **Tool** — which tools are called most frequently
- **Time period** — hourly, daily, or weekly views

### Performance metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Average duration** | Mean execution time in milliseconds |
| **Min duration** | Fastest execution |
| **Max duration** | Slowest execution |
| **Total rows returned** | Total number of data rows served |
| **Success rate** | Percentage of successful executions |

## Usage progress bar

The progress bar shows your current consumption relative to your plan limit:

| Usage Level | Color | Action |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| 0-79% | Green | Normal usage |
| 80-89% | Yellow | Warning — consider upgrading |
| 90-99% | Orange | Critical — approaching limit |
| 100% | Red | Limit reached — executions blocked |

## Upgrade card

When you're approaching your limit, an **Upgrade Card** appears suggesting the next plan tier. It shows:

- Your current plan and usage
- The recommended plan with its higher limits
- A direct upgrade button

## Filtering and time ranges

You can filter the dashboard by:

- **Time period** — current billing cycle, last 7 days, last 30 days
- **Project** — view consumption for a specific project
- **Tool** — drill down into a specific tool's usage

## Hourly statistics

Surf Data aggregates execution data into hourly buckets for efficient querying. Each bucket tracks:

- Total, success, error, and timeout counts
- Average, minimum, and maximum duration
- Total rows returned
- Error breakdown by error code

This enables fast rendering of charts and metrics even with high execution volumes.

## Exporting data

You can export consumption data via the [REST API](/en/api-reference/introduction) for use in external analytics tools or custom dashboards.
