## Overview

The **Evaluations (Evals)** dashboard provides detailed insights into your tool executions. Review individual invocations, track success rates, and identify issues.

<Note>
  The Evals dashboard is available on the **Growth** and **Enterprise** plans.
</Note>

## Accessing evaluations

Navigate to **Evals** in the sidebar to view the evaluations dashboard.

## Invocation logs

Every tool execution is recorded as an **invocation log** with the following details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Tool name** | Which MCP tool was called |
| **Token** | Which token authenticated the request (name + prefix) |
| **Status** | `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, or `TIMEOUT` |
| **Query template** | The SQL query with parameter placeholders |
| **Executed query** | The actual SQL query that was run |
| **Parameters** | The arguments passed by the agent |
| **Duration** | Execution time in milliseconds |
| **Row count** | Number of rows returned |
| **Timestamp** | When the execution started and completed |
| **Error details** | Error code and message (if failed) |

## Filtering logs

Filter invocation logs by:

- **Status** — Success, Error, Timeout
- **Tool** — specific MCP tool
- **Token** — specific access token
- **Date range** — custom time window
- **Project** — specific project

## Identifying issues

### Common error patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SQL syntax errors">
    **Symptom**: Status is `ERROR` with a database error message.

    **Solution**: Review the executed query in the log. Check for:
    - Typos in column or table names
    - Missing quotes or brackets
    - Invalid parameter substitutions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection timeouts">
    **Symptom**: Status is `TIMEOUT`.

    **Solution**:
    - Check your database server's network accessibility
    - Verify the query isn't too complex or returning too many rows
    - Ensure your database isn't overloaded
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission errors">
    **Symptom**: Status is `ERROR` with "permission denied" message.

    **Solution**: Verify your database user has SELECT permissions on the required tables and schemas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit reached">
    **Symptom**: Status is `ERROR` with error code `LIMIT_REACHED`.

    **Solution**: Your organization has exceeded its monthly execution limit. [Upgrade your plan](/en/organizations/billing) or wait for the next billing cycle.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance analysis

Use the evals dashboard to optimize your tools:

1. **Identify slow queries** — sort by duration to find the slowest executions
2. **Check row counts** — high row counts may indicate overly broad queries
3. **Review error rates** — tools with high error rates may need parameter validation
4. **Monitor trends** — watch for degrading performance over time

## Audit trail

Invocation logs serve as a complete audit trail for compliance:

- **Who** accessed data (token identification)
- **What** data was queried (executed query + parameters)
- **When** the access occurred (timestamps)
- **How much** data was returned (row count)
- **Result** of the access (success/error)

This audit trail supports [LGPD compliance](/en/security/lgpd) requirements for data access transparency.
