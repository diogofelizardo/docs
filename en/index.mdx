## What is Surf Data?

Surf Data is a managed platform that lets you expose databases to AI agents via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** in minutes, not sprints.

Instead of building and maintaining custom MCP servers, Surf Data provides a complete infrastructure for connecting **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** databases to any AI agent — with built-in security, LGPD compliance, and PII masking.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your database">
    Add your PostgreSQL or MySQL connection. Surf Data encrypts and securely stores your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create SQL tools">
    Write SQL queries as reusable tools with parameterized inputs. Define what data agents can access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure security policies">
    Enable PII masking and set data access policies to ensure LGPD compliance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and integrate">
    Publish your project and get an MCP endpoint URL with a Bearer token. Connect it to Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>
