## Publish project

Publishes a project, making its tools available via the MCP endpoint.

```
POST /api/projects/{projectId}/publish
```

<ParamField path="projectId" type="string" required>
  The project ID.
</ParamField>

### Requirements

- The project must have **at least one MCP tool**

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "isPublished": true
}
```

### Errors

| Status | Error | Cause |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `400` | No tools found | Project has no MCP tools |

---

## Unpublish project

Unpublishes a project and deactivates all its tokens.

```
DELETE /api/projects/{projectId}/publish
```

<ParamField path="projectId" type="string" required>
  The project ID.
</ParamField>

### Process

This is a transactional operation that:
1. Sets `isPublished` to `false`
2. Marks all project tokens as inactive (`isActive = false`)

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "isPublished": false
}
```

<Warning>
  Unpublishing immediately deactivates all tokens. Agents will receive authentication errors. You can republish later, but you'll need to generate new tokens or reactivate existing ones.
</Warning>
