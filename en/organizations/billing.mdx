## Managing your subscription

### Upgrading

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Upgrade Plan**
3. Select your new plan
4. Confirm the change

Upgrades take effect immediately. You'll be billed a prorated amount for the remainder of the current billing period.

### Downgrading

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Change Plan**
3. Select the lower plan
4. Confirm the change

<Warning>
  Downgrading may cause you to exceed the new plan's limits. Review your current usage before downgrading:
  - **Datasources**: Excess datasources won't be deleted but cannot be edited until you're under the limit
  - **Members**: Excess members won't be removed but you cannot invite new ones
  - **Executions**: If you've exceeded the new plan's monthly limit, tool executions will be blocked until the next billing cycle
</Warning>

### Cancellation

To cancel your subscription:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Cancel Subscription**
3. Confirm cancellation

Your account remains active until the end of the current billing period. After that, your projects become read-only and MCP endpoints stop accepting requests.

## Payment methods

Surf Data uses **Stripe** for payment processing. We accept:
- Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- Debit cards
- Boleto bancário (for annual plans)

### Invoices

Access your invoices from **Settings** → **Billing**. Invoices are generated monthly and include:
- Plan charges

## Free trial

All plans include a **14-day free trial**. During the trial:
- Full access to all features of your selected plan
- Credit card is required at sign-up
- Cancel anytime during the trial with no charge
- Automatic billing starts after 14 days if not cancelled

## Usage-based limits

Execution limits reset at the beginning of each billing cycle. Track your usage in the [Consumption Dashboard](/en/monitoring/consumption).

When you approach your limit:
- **80% threshold** — warning notification
- **90% threshold** — critical notification
- **100% limit** — tool executions are blocked

See [Alerts](/en/monitoring/alerts) for notification configuration.
