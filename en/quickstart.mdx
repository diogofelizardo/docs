## Prerequisites

- A Surf Data account ([sign up here](https://surfdata.com.br/sign-up))
- Access to a PostgreSQL or MySQL database
- An AI agent that supports MCP (Claude, Cursor, etc.)

## Step-by-step guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your organization">
    After signing up, you'll be guided through creating your organization. This is where your team, projects, and billing are managed.

    Choose a plan that fits your needs:

    | Plan | Executions/month | Datasources |
    |------|-----------------|-------------|
    | Starter (R$99) | 5,000 | 1 |
    | Team (R$199) | 10,000 | 3 |
    | Growth (R$499) | 25,000 | 5 |

    All plans include a **14-day free trial**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a project">
    Navigate to the **Dashboard** and click **New Project**. Give it a name and description.

    A project groups your datasources, views, and MCP tools together. Think of it as a workspace for a specific use case (e.g., "Customer Support Agent" or "Sales Analytics").
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a datasource">
    Inside your project, click **Add Datasource** and choose your database type:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="PostgreSQL">
        Enter your connection details:
        ```
        Host: your-db-host.com
        Port: 5432
        Database: mydb
        Username: readonly_user
        Password: ********
        SSL: Enabled
        ```
        Or use a connection string:
        ```
        postgresql://readonly_user:password@your-db-host.com:5432/mydb?sslmode=require
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MySQL">
        Enter your connection details:
        ```
        Host: your-db-host.com
        Port: 3306
        Database: mydb
        Username: readonly_user
        Password: ********
        ```
        Or use a connection string:
        ```
        mysql://readonly_user:password@your-db-host.com:3306/mydb
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Demo">
        Select **Demo** to use a pre-configured sample database. No credentials needed — perfect for testing.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Click **Test Connection** to verify, then **Connect** to save.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an Agent View">
    An Agent View is a saved SQL query that defines what data is available. Click **New View** and write your query:

    ```sql
    SELECT id, name, email, created_at
    FROM customers
    WHERE status = 'active'
    ```

    Give it a descriptive name like `active_customers`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an MCP Tool">
    Tools are the functions that AI agents can call. Create a tool linked to your view:

    - **Name**: `get_customer_by_id`
    - **Description**: "Retrieves customer details by their ID"
    - **SQL Query**:
      ```sql
      SELECT id, name, email, created_at
      FROM customers
      WHERE id = {customer_id}
      ```
    - **Parameters**: Add `customer_id` (type: string, required: true)

    Click **Test Run** with a sample value to verify it works.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your project">
    Click the **Publish** button to make your tools available via MCP:

    1. Select which tools to publish
    2. Name your access token (e.g., "claude-integration")
    3. Copy your **MCP endpoint URL** and **Bearer token**

    <Warning>
      Save your token immediately — it's only shown once and cannot be retrieved later.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to your AI agent">
    Use the MCP endpoint URL and token to connect your agent.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Claude Desktop">
        Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "surf-data": {
              "url": "https://surfdata.com.br/mcp/http",
              "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here"
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Cursor">
        Add to your `.cursor/mcp.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "surf-data": {
              "url": "https://surfdata.com.br/mcp/http",
              "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here"
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Your agent now has access to the tools you published. Try asking it: *"Get the details for customer ID 123"*.
  </Step>
