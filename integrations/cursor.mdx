## Overview

Cursor IDE supports MCP servers natively, allowing you to query your databases directly from the editor. Surf Data tools appear alongside Cursor's built-in tools.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish your project">
    Make sure your Surf Data project is [published](/platform/publishing) and you have a Bearer token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the MCP config">
    Create or edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "surf-data": {
          "url": "https://app.surfdata.io/mcp/http",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer sk_live_your-token-here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Cursor">
    Restart Cursor or reload the window. Your Surf Data tools should now appear in the MCP tools panel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

In Cursor's AI chat, you can reference your database tools:

> "Use surf-data to look up the customer with email john@example.com"

> "Query the monthly_revenue tool and help me update the dashboard chart"

> "Check the orders database for any orders created today"

Cursor will call the appropriate Surf Data tool and use the results to help with your coding tasks.

## Project-level vs global config

### Project-level (recommended)

Place `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root. This is ideal for:
- Team sharing (add to version control, exclude the token)
- Project-specific datasources

### Global config

For personal tools across all projects, use the global Cursor settings to add the MCP server.

## Using with environment variables

To avoid committing tokens to version control, use environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "surf-data": {
      "url": "https://app.surfdata.io/mcp/http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${SURF_DATA_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set the environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export SURF_DATA_TOKEN="sk_live_your-token-here"
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP server not connecting">
    - Verify the `.cursor/mcp.json` file is in the correct location
    - Check the JSON syntax is valid
    - Restart Cursor completely (not just reload)
    - Check Cursor's developer console for error messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools not showing up">
    - Verify your Surf Data project is published
    - Check the Bearer token is valid
    - Try the MCP endpoint directly with curl to verify connectivity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission errors">
    - Verify the token hasn't expired or been revoked
    - Check you haven't exceeded your execution limit
  </Accordion>
