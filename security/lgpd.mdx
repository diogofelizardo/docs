description: "How Surf Data helps you meet Brazilian data protection requirements"
---

## Overview

The **Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)** is Brazil's comprehensive data protection law. When using AI agents with production data, LGPD compliance is critical. Surf Data is designed from the ground up to help you meet these requirements.

## LGPD principles supported

| LGPD Principle | How Surf Data helps |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose Limitation** | Tools expose only the data needed for specific use cases |
| **Data Minimization** | Agent Views control exactly which columns are accessible |
| **Security** | Encrypted connections, encrypted storage, token-based auth |
| **Transparency** | Complete audit logs of every data access |
| **Accountability** | Usage tracking and alert system |

## Built-in compliance features

### Data access control

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent Views" icon="eye">
    Control exactly which tables, columns, and rows agents can access through curated SQL queries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="PII Masking" icon="mask">
    Automatically mask sensitive data (emails, CPFs, phone numbers) before it reaches agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Read-only Access" icon="lock">
    Destructive SQL operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP) are blocked at the platform level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Row Limits" icon="list-ol">
    Automatic LIMIT 100 on all queries prevents bulk data extraction.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Audit and transparency

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Invocation Logs" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Every tool execution is logged with the query, parameters, user, timestamp, and result count.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Usage Tracking" icon="chart-bar">
    Monitor data access patterns per organization, project, and tool.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Token Tracking" icon="key">
    Know exactly which token (and therefore which agent) accessed your data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Alert System" icon="bell">
    Get notified when usage approaches or exceeds defined thresholds.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Compliance checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your Surf Data setup meets LGPD requirements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify personal data">
    Audit your database tables and identify columns containing personal data (PII):
    - Names, emails, phone numbers
    - CPF, CNPJ, RG numbers
    - Addresses, location data
    - Financial information
    - Health data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply data minimization">
    Create Agent Views that expose **only** the columns agents need. Exclude all unnecessary personal data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable PII masking">
    For tools that must access personal data, enable [data masking policies](/security/data-masking) to protect sensitive fields.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use read-only credentials">
    Configure datasource connections with read-only database users to prevent data modification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up monitoring">
    Enable [usage alerts](/monitoring/alerts) to track data access and detect anomalies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review audit logs">
    Regularly review [invocation logs](/monitoring/evals) to ensure data access patterns match expected usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document your setup">
    Maintain records of your data access policies, masking rules, and access controls for regulatory audits.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data residency

Surf Data processes and stores data in compliance with LGPD requirements:

- User data and configuration are stored in managed databases
- Database queries are executed in real-time and results are not cached or stored
- Invocation logs record metadata (query text, parameters, row counts) but not query results
- Token hashes are stored — plain tokens are never persisted

<Note>
  Enterprise plan customers can request dedicated infrastructure with specific data residency requirements. Contact our sales team for details.
</Note>

## Data subject rights

LGPD grants individuals specific rights over their data. Surf Data supports these through:

| Right | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| **Right to access** | Audit logs show what data was accessed and when |
| **Right to correction** | Agents have read-only access; corrections must be done directly in the database |
| **Right to deletion** | Delete user accounts, organizations, and all associated data via the dashboard |
| **Right to portability** | Export your configuration (projects, views, tools) via the API |
| **Right to revoke consent** | Revoke MCP tokens to immediately cut off agent access |
