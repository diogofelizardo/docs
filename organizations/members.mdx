## Managing members

- **Name** and **email**
- **Role** (Admin or Member)
- **Joined date**
- **Status** (active or pending)

### Changing roles

Admins can change a member's role:
1. Find the member in the members table
2. Click the role dropdown
3. Select the new role

### Removing members

Admins can remove members from the organization:
1. Find the member in the members table
2. Click the remove button
3. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
  Removing a member immediately revokes their access to all projects and data in the organization.
</Warning>

## Pending invitations

View and manage pending invitations:

## Plan limits

The number of team members depends on your plan:

| Plan | Max Members |

| Growth | Unlimited |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

When you reach the member limit, you'll need to upgrade your plan or remove existing members before inviting new ones.
