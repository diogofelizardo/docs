## Overview

**Publishing** is the process of making your project's MCP Tools accessible to AI agents. When you publish a project, Surf Data generates an MCP endpoint URL and Bearer token that agents use to discover and call your tools.

## Publishing workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Publish dialog">
    Click the **Publish** button in your project editor. This opens a step-by-step wizard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select tools">
    Choose which tools to make available. You can:
    - Select individual tools
    - Use **Select All** to include everything
    - Review your selection before proceeding

    Only selected tools will be discoverable via `tools/list`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure token">
    Name your access token (e.g., "claude-production", "n8n-integration"). The name helps you identify tokens later.

    You'll see a preview of:
    - The MCP endpoint URL
    - Which tools will be published
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy credentials">
    After publishing, you'll receive:
    - **MCP Endpoint URL**: `https://app.surfdata.io/mcp/http`
    - **Bearer Token**: A unique access token

    <Warning>
      The Bearer token is shown **only once**. Copy it immediately and store it securely. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new token.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## MCP endpoint

The MCP endpoint URL is the same for all projects:

```
https://app.surfdata.io/mcp/http
```

The Bearer token in the `Authorization` header determines which project and tools the agent can access.

### Authentication

All requests must include the Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_<your-token>
```

### Supported methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `initialize` | Handshake — returns server capabilities |
| `tools/list` | Returns available tools and their schemas |
| `tools/call` | Executes a tool with arguments |
| `ping` | Health check |

## Unpublishing

You can unpublish a project at any time:

1. Open the project settings
2. Click **Unpublish**
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Unpublishing immediately deactivates all tokens for the project. Agents will no longer be able to access your tools. This action is reversible — you can republish later.
</Warning>

## Managing tokens

After publishing, you can manage your tokens from the project settings:

- **Generate new tokens** — create additional tokens for different agents or environments
- **Activate/deactivate** — toggle tokens without deleting them
- **Set expiration** — optionally set an expiration date
- **Revoke** — permanently delete a token

See [Token Management](/security/tokens) for detailed token management.
