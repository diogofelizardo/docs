## Adding a datasource

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Navigate to your project from the Dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Datasource">
    In the left sidebar, click the **+** button next to Datasources.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose database type">
    Select **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, or **Demo**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter connection details">
    You can connect using a **connection URL** or **manual fields**.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Connection URL">
        Paste your full connection string:

        ```
        postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database?sslmode=require
        ```

        ```
        mysql://user:password@host:3306/database
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Manual fields">
        Fill in the individual fields:

        | Field | Required | Description |
        |-------|----------|-------------|
        | Host | Yes | Database server hostname |
        | Port | No | Default: 5432 (PG) or 3306 (MySQL) |
        | Database | Yes | Database name |
        | Username | Yes | Database user |
        | Password | Yes | User password |
        | SSL | No | Enable SSL (PostgreSQL only) |
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify connectivity. You'll see:
    - Success message with the number of tables found
    - Or an error message with details about the failure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Connect** to create the datasource. Credentials are encrypted before storage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connection security

All datasource credentials are **encrypted at rest** using AES encryption. The raw credentials are:

- Never stored in plain text
- Never returned to the client after creation
- Decrypted only at runtime when executing queries
- Transmitted over encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)

<Note>
  We strongly recommend using **read-only database users**. While Surf Data blocks destructive queries at the application level, a read-only user provides defense in depth.
</Note>

## Browsing tables

Once connected, you can browse the tables and columns available in your datasource:

1. Select the datasource in the left sidebar
2. The table browser shows all available tables and views
3. Click a table to see its columns with types
4. Use this information to write your Agent Views and Tool queries

## Editing a datasource

You can update a datasource's name and connection configuration at any time:

1. Select the datasource in the left sidebar
2. Click the settings icon
3. Update the fields
4. Test the connection
5. Save changes

## Deleting a datasource

<Warning>
  Deleting a datasource also removes all Agent Views and MCP Tools linked to it. Make sure to update or recreate them on another datasource if needed.
</Warning>

## Plan limits

The number of datasources per organization depends on your plan:

| Plan | Max Datasources |
|------|----------------|
| Starter | 1 |
| Team | 3 |
| Growth | 5 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |
